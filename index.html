        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>As I mentioned above, I started learning web-dev right after finishing my military service at the beginning of 2020. Although it was a tough year for a lot of people, mine was a lot different. For me, 2020 was the year of making progress. As for
          someone who spent the four years of university figuring out and discovering himself with no material result in hand after all of that time passed. I have learned -and still learning- web development until I am comfortable working with React
          and Redux for the Front-End and building simple APIs with Express for Back-End. But the problem that I faced was that at some point I didn't remember how to write Vanilla JavaScript. So, That's why I am participating in this scholarship. I needed
          a refresh ðŸ˜„.</p>

        <h2>Some Projects</h2>
        <h3>In my journey of learning. I loved React so much. So, here are some of my React projects:</h3>
        <br>
        <h4><a href="https://fluffy-cat.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Fluffy Cas Store</a></h4>
        <p>This project was the first big project with React -after learning the basics-. I didn't involve that much in the code but, it was a big step in entering the world of React</p>
        <br>
        <h4><a href="https://my-first-todo-app.netlify.app/" target="_blank">The Bad Start Of A To-Do App</a></h4>
        <p>Well, in this project, I made a lot of mistakes and learned some lessons:</p>
        <p>
          1. UI and UX matter a lot than I thought. <br>2. How to use React's Context API. <br>3. I needed to learn Redux.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/alimr70/my-redux-todo-app" target="_blank">Microsoft To-Do Clone</a></h4>
        <p>
          <b>This is not a finished project yet.</b> But, I learned my lessons:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. For UI and UX I dicided to learn about them later and focus on the code instead by cloning my favourite to do app of Microsoft To DO. <br>2. I learned how to use React-Redux and it was awesome.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><a href="https://my-google-login.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">A Full Atack Google Authentication</a></h4>
        <p>I created this project using Express and Passport for Back-End and React for the Front-End as a boilerplate for Google authentication. After several failed projects this one worked fine.
